Shimmy is hungry.

And when he's hungry he thouches his food bowl and looks at me.

So I figured, he's a big boy, he can feed himself!


Components:
- A 12v DC motor with gear box 29 rpm
- For the auger I've used a garden plant drill. e.g. https://www.banggood.com/60050mm-Garden-Auger-Earth-Planter-Drill-Bit-Post-Hole-Digger-Auger-Drill-Accessories-p-1538097.html?rmmds=detail-left-hotproducts&cur_warehouse=USA
