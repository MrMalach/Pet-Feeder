That's Shimmy

Shimmy is hungry.

And when he's hungry he thouches his food bowl and looks at me.

So I figured, he's a big boy, he can feed himself!

The idea is that Shimmy will press that lever on the left and ask for food.

He will be limited to two feeds & another half a dose per day.

Three leds mark each feed, feeds are documented for 7 days back.

Two buttons control the menu, setting feeding time, clock or for showing the feeding history.

Now all thats left is to teach him how to use it and hope that he'll still like me ;)
